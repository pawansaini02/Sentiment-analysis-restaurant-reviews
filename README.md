# Sentiment Analysis :
Sentiment analysis refers to the broad area of natural language processing which deals with the computational study of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in text. Sentiment Analysis (SA) or Opinion Mining (OM) aims at learning peopleâ€™s opinions, attitudes and emotions towards an entity. The entity can represent individuals, events or topics. An immense amount of research has been performed in the area of sentiment analysis. But most of them focused on classifying formal and larger pieces of text data like reviews. Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is a sub machine learning task where we want to determine the general sentiment of a given
document. Using machine learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective information of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative. It is a really useful analysis since we could possibly determine the overall opinion about a selling object, or predict stock markets for a given company like, if most people think positive about it, possibly its stock markets will increase, and so on. Sentiment analysis is actually far from to be solved since the language is very complex (objectivity/subjectivity, negation, vocabulary, grammar,...) but it is also why it is very interesting to work on.
